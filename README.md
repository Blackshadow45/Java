# My Java Learning Journey ðŸš€
Overview
Welcome to my personal Java repository! This space is where I've practiced, experimented, and solidified my understanding of various Java concepts. Think of it as a living notebook of my Java learning journey. Whether you're a fellow learner, or just curious to see some hands-on examples, you'll find a collection of programs covering fundamental to more advanced topics here.

What You'll Find Here
This repository reflects my active learning process. Here's what you can expect :

Practiced Concepts: Code snippets and programs directly tied to specific Java concepts I've been learning or reviewing.
Clear & Commented Examples: I've aimed for clean, readable code with comments where helpful, to make the logic easy to follow.
Hands-On Implementations: These aren't just theoretical examples; they're practical applications of what I've learned.

Topics I've Explored (and You'll See Code For!)
This section will give you an idea of the ground I've covered so far. As I learn more, this list will grow!

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: Hands-on practice with Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.
Fundamental Data Structures: My implementations and usage of Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and basic Hash Maps.
Core Algorithms: Examples of common algorithms like sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort) and searching (e.g., Binary Search).
Exception Handling: How I've practiced try-catch-finally blocks and implemented custom exceptions.
File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
Java Collections Framework: Practical usage of ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and other utility classes.
Basic Multithreading: Simple programs demonstrating thread creation and synchronization.
...and many more as I continue learning! Feel free to dive into the src/ folder to see all the examples.

Contributions & Feedback
This is primarily my learning space, but I'm always open to constructive feedback! If you spot an error, have a suggestion for a cleaner way to write something, or just want to discuss a concept, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
